# Probability of Habitable Planets Calculator
This Python program calculates the probability of habitable planets in the universe based on various user input factors.

# How to Use
- Clone or download the repository.
- Navigate to the directory where the habitable_planets.py file is located.
- Run the command python habitable_planets.py.
- Enter the required input values when prompted.
- The program will output the calculated probability of habitable planets in the universe.

# Factors Considered
The following factors are taken into account in the probability calculation:

- Distance from the star
- Size of the planet
- Age of the planet
- Composition of the planet
- Strength of the planet's magnetic field
- Stability of the planetary orbit
- Presence of liquid water
- Presence of organic molecules
- Stability of the planet's climate
- Presence of plate tectonics
- Distance from other stars or planetary systems
- Geological activity
- Parent star's metallicity
- Availability of energy sources
- Presence of a moon
- Level of stellar activity
- Strength of the planetary magnetic field
- Presence of planetary surface features
- Density and composition of the interstellar medium
- Rate of planetary rotation
- Planetary obliquity
- Planetary crust thickness
- Rate of planetary atmosphere loss
- Planetary evolutionary history
- Presence of a global magnetic field
- Type and intensity of the planet's surface radiation
- Availability of nutrients and resources for life
- Role of impacts from asteroids or comets
- Presence of exoplanet moons or rings 

# Equation
The equation used to calculate the probability of habitable planets is:

Probability of habitable planets = (f_d * f_p * n_e * f_l * f_i * f_c * L) / N

Where:

- f_d = fraction of stars with planets
- f_p = fraction of planets that could support life
- n_e = number of planets per star that could support life
- f_l = fraction of planets where life actually arises
- f_i = fraction of planets where intelligent life arises
- f_c = fraction of the planet's life during which the intelligent species communicates
- L = length of time that the intelligent species communicates
- N = total number of stars in the universe
